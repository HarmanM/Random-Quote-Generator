# Random-Quote-Generator

## Description

This is a personal project that I made to further my understanding of AJAX, JSON and APIs. This project uses the Forismatic API and AJAX requests to get random quotes and display them to users. no quotes have been hardcoded, and all quotes are fetched from the API randomly. Furthermore, This page changes to a random color each time the "get new quote button" is pressed. I also added a button that lets the user tweet the current quote that they are viewing.

The idea for this project came from FreeCodeCamp.
